<h1>Leaky Lockdown Demo</h1>
<p>100,000 people, with 5 infected people to start. They are organized in 50 "pods" which can be thought of as states/cities. Each pod is 2000 people.</p>

<ol>
	<li>The sickness lasts for 2 weeks. </li>
	<li>Each day, each infected person (who isn't quarantined) is in contact with 30 people <div style="display:none;">(exposures per week)</div>. </li>
	<li> However, depending on the distancing compliance (rec?) and handwashing (infector?), the contact may not result in an "exposure". In this scenario, there is noHandwash=1.0 and distancingCompliance=0.</li>
	<li> If exposed, there is a 5% change of getting infected.	If infected, there is a 25% asymptomatic rate.</li>
	<li> When they are infected, if they are SYMPTOMATIC, there is a 50% chance they are quarantined.</li>
	<li> There is also "pod quarantining" at 1%. What this means is that each person who is symptomatic in a pod has 1% chance of causing the </i>whole</i> pod to go into pod quarantining. If there are 50 symptomatic people, this will be a 50% chance of pod quarantine. </li>
	<li>If one is quarantined, there is no chance of infection.</li> <br>

	<li> A person can infect others in week 1 and week 2.
	<li> Everyone who is "recovered" after week 2 cannot be re-infected.
	<li> There are no deaths in this model run, simply because you can just randomly pick 2 or 3% who die.
